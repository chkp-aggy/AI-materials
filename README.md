# Cloud Security R&D AI Hackathon

## About
This repository is dedicated to the Cloud Security R&D AI Hackathon for CloudGuard taking place on the 17-18/9/2024.

### Why this repo?
The purpose of this repository is to provide easy first steps for using GenAI.

### What's in here?
This repo contains two main parts. These two parts use the same logic - but differ in the approach (Notebook vs app)
1. `Introduction.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook with a concise, minimal, usage of GPT
2. `app/`: A directory containing a 'demo app' for easy bootstrapping GPT-based applications

### Prerequisits
This projects assumes the following:
* You're familliar with git, and GitLab
* You're familiar with Python
* You're familiar with Jupyter Notebooks

## What do I need to do?
1. Clone the repo
2. Choose between the Jupyter notebook (`Introduction`) and the Python project (`app`)
3. [Get you API key](https://wiki.checkpoint.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=554281566#CloudSecurityR&DAIHackathon-AI_ENVIRONMENT)
4. Add it to the relevant cell (Jupyter) or the `.env` file (app)
5. Run all cells (Jupyter) or `gpt_query.py` (app)
6. Verify you're able to send a query to GPT and parse its reponse

## TL;DR
* You have a Notebook that demonstrates the most basic usage of GPT via API, see `Introduction.ipynb`
* You also have a demo app under the `app` directory
* Choose one and run them. Don't forget to get you [API key](https://wiki.checkpoint.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=554281566#CloudSecurityR&DAIHackathon-AI_ENVIRONMENT).
